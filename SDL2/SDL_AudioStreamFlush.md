# SDL_AudioStreamFlush

Tell the stream that you're done sending data, and anything being buffered should be converted/resampled and made available immediately.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_AudioStreamFlush(SDL_AudioStream *stream);

```

## Remarks

It is legal to add more data to a stream after flushing, but there will be
audio gaps in the output. Generally this is intended to signal the end of
input, so the complete output becomes available.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.7.
