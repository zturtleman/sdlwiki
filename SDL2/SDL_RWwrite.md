# SDL_RWwrite

Write to an [SDL_RWops](SDL_RWops) data stream.

## Syntax

```c
size_t SDL_RWwrite(SDL_RWops *context,
                   const void *ptr, size_t size,
                   size_t num);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **context**     | a pointer to an [SDL_RWops](SDL_RWops) structure |
| **ptr**         | a pointer to a buffer containing data to write   |
| **size**        | the size of an object to write, in bytes         |
| **num**         | the number of objects to write                   |

## Return Value

Returns the number of objects written, which will be less than **num** on
error; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function writes exactly `num` objects each of size `size` from the
area pointed at by `ptr` to the stream. If this fails for any reason, it'll
return less than `num` to demonstrate how far the write progressed. On
success, it returns `num`.

[SDL_RWwrite](SDL_RWwrite) is actually a function wrapper that calls the
[SDL_RWops](SDL_RWops)'s `write` method appropriately, to simplify
application development.

Prior to SDL 2.0.10, this function was a macro.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.10.
