= SDL_GetNumInputDevices =
Use this function to get the number of ,,mouse,, input devices available.

<span style="color: green;">This API is not limited to mice. Should it say "pointing" or similar instead to specify the type of input device (ie: not a keyboard) without being overly specific?</span>


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int SDL_GetNumInputDevices(void)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.  ???
<span style="color: green;">Source?</span>
<span style="color: green;">Would it be helpful to mention the types of input devices it would or would not count?</span>
