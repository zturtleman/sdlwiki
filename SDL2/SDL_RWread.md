# SDL_RWread

Read from a data source.

## Syntax

```c
size_t SDL_RWread(SDL_RWops *context,
                  void *ptr, size_t size,
                  size_t maxnum);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **context**     | a pointer to an [SDL_RWops](SDL_RWops) structure |
| **ptr**         | a pointer to a buffer to read data into          |
| **size**        | the size of each object to read, in bytes        |
| **maxnum**      | the maximum number of objects to be read         |

## Return Value

Returns the number of objects read, or 0 at error or end of file; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function reads up to `maxnum` objects each of size `size` from the
data source to the area pointed at by `ptr`. This function may read less
objects than requested. It will return zero when there has been an error or
the data stream is completely read.

[SDL_RWread](SDL_RWread)() is actually a function wrapper that calls the
[SDL_RWops](SDL_RWops)'s `read` method appropriately, to simplify
application development.

Prior to SDL 2.0.10, this function was a macro.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.10.
